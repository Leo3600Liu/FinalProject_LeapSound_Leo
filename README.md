# FinalProject_LeapSound_Leo


This is my final project, and this is the screen shot. My final project is a hand & sound-controlling app.

My project base on ofxGenSound and Leap Motion. The whole idea for my project is for some people who cannot afford the instruments. Those people can play music with my App, without buying a very expensive instrument.

In the beginning, I want to use Leap Motion to track my fingers. When the music starts, I will put my hand into the area, which can be tracked by Leap Motion. Then I can move each finger to play the music. Each finger will give the order to leap motion, and the music will change when every finger changes their position. For example, when I move one finger up, the tone will change. When I move another finger, the pitch will change. Each finger has their specific and individual orders.

Finally, when I finish the final project. I found out that there is something different than my thoughts. I also will put my hand into the area when the music starts, but the Leap Motion cannot track each finger of mine. It only can track one finger in one hand. It does not matter which finger it is, and it has to be one finger. When I move my one hand up and done, the tone will change. If I do not put my hand into the Leap Motion tracking area, the sound will not change and will stay the same.

All in all, it is a great opportunity for me to design a finger controlling music apps. Although it is rudiment because it only can be tracked by one finger, it has a lot of pretentious for me to continue designing it. I will try to add more instruct into it to improve my project in the future. I will track both hands at the same time, and give a different order for each hand.
